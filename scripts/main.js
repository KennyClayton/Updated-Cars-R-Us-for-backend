// I also asked chatGPT which provided this response:
/*
"So, the reason why renderAllHTML is called at the bottom is to trigger the execution of the function and update the HTML content within the mainContainer element. It ensures that the initial rendering of the HTML content happens when the script is run. Without calling renderAllHTML(), the HTML content wouldn't be updated initially, and the CarsRUs data wouldn't be displayed on the webpage."

// this module needs to regenerate HTML after changes are made by the user on the webpage (as the user interacts with the options??? ot just after the click to confirm the order?). So below we added an event listener to do that.
document.addEventListener("stateChanged", event => {
    console.log("State of data has changed. Regenerating HTML...")
